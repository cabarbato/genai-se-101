# GenAI/LangChain 101 for Software Engineers

This is the companion codebase for the GenAI 101 for Software Engineers presentation. This workshop assumes _some_ knowlege of python, but hopefully the documentation here and the commentary within the code should be enough for those who don't to follow along. The frontend is written in Typescript, but we won't be focusing on it much in the workshop.

Below are the basic elements of this app, and a super basic explanation of how they work.

## LangChain
This is our framework that will interface with the LLM. LangChain was chosen in this scenario in case I wasn't able to stick with a specific model, since it supports [a ton of LLMs]([url](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/)).

### TODO:
[] Readme - Description of Frontend
[] Readme - Description of API
[] Readme - Description of the data source
[] Actually build the app
